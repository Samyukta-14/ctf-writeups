## Challenge

We've received a menacing extortion email from an unknown sender, claiming that sensitive data has been stolen from the company. The email demands a ransom and threatens to release the data if the demand is not met within 48 hours. Unfortunately, it's clear based on the extortion email that the sender attempted to send this email before... Since the demand's due date is relative, we need to find the first email sent so we can estimate a lower bound on the deadline for the legal and finance teams to plan around. Can you trace the digital breadcrumbs and find the first extortion email sent by this threat actor?

## Solution

I needed to dig through SMTP logs using the OpenSearch dashboard to find an earlier version of the extortion email. My strategy was to search for keywords that would likely appear in similar threatening messages.

### Steps
1. Started with some keywords - Tried searching for terms like 'attack', 'data', 'ransom', 'immediately' and 'locked'.
2. These keywords were either not returning any results or were too broad. So I combined the keywords and used combinations like "ransom" AND "Bitcoin", "data" and "sensitive"
3. I finally found the email that was sent before the known extortion email.

## Notes
- Key technique: Strategic keyword combination searches in log analysis tools
- What made this challenging: Had to think like the attacker - what words would they consistently use across multiple emails?
- Time taken: 20 minutes
