## Challenge

What a way to start your day... you've just logged on as a member of Personalyz.io's Cybersecurity team and see the last thing any cyber professional wants to see: an extortion email at the top of your inbox. Looks like we've received a menacing message from an unknown sender, claiming that sensitive data has been stolen from the company. The email demands a ransom and threatens to release the data if the demand is not met within 48 hours. Given the nature of the data we process, this is a serious threat to us and our customers. You've been tasked with performing some analysis on the email itself to ensure our responding teams can respond appropriately. Can you determine the sender's original IP address?

## Solution

I opened the .eml file with a text editor (vim) to access the raw email contents, focusing on the email headers, to retrive the metadata of the message's transmission path. I noticed that the email header contained multiple "Received" headers, each indicating a server that forwarded the email. The bottom-most IP address reveals the first sender.

### Steps
1. Started by scanning the entire email - Noticed there were several IP addresses mentioned, but wasn't sure which one was actually the source
2. Focused on the "Received:" headers - Started reading from top to bottom initially, but realized I was seeing the delivery path in reverse order
3. Worked backwards through the mail relay chain - Found that 252.44.98.29 appeared as the first sender in the earliest "Received:" entry, making it the true originating IP

## Notes
- Key technique: Email header analysis focusing on "Received:" field chronology
- What made this interesting: Had to think backwards - the first server to handle the email appears last in the header chain
- Time taken: 15 minutes
